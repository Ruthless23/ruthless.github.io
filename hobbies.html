                        Hobbies are a great way to relax and unwind. These are done after a stressful day at school, college, or office. There is no rule of what can be termed as a hobby. It could be anything, from stamp collection to painting, or even travelling. Anything can be considered as a hobby if it relaxes your mind.

                    <div class="hobbiespara2">My hobby is playing football.Football is the most popular sport in the world and is played in a lot of countries. I started to play football when I was ten. At the first time, my father did not allow me to play football because he thought it would be dangerous for me. He used to bit me when he knew I had played football. But I did not give up playing football because I liked it. I used to play football two hours everyday when I was a student. Unfortunately, my leg was broken when my friend and I had played football with other team. They tried to kick the ball out of the goal frame but it hit my leg. I was rushed to the hospital because a wound was very serious.I had to stay at home with a big leg for three months. Six months late, I could go without any help and I continued to play football because I loved it. </div>
                <div class="hobbiespara3">Football is not only my hobby but also help me improve my health. Playing football helps me increase muscle and bone strength, reduce body fat and improve my health due to shift between walking, running and sprinting. Football will build my leg strength and increase my concentration span. Playing football is a good way for me to get in shape and create positive fitness habits. I can get a lot of benefits from playing a team sport like phaying football.</div>
